# EEG
I'm going to build and use an EEG machine for abstract and concrete things! Because why not! I'll be following [this guide](https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-EEG-and-ECG-Circuit). Another [Arduino based one exists too](https://www.instructables.com/id/Mini-Arduino-Portable-EEG-Brain-Wave-Monitor-/)
