# EEG Headset Quotes
Compilation of quotes/recommendations for EEG headsets I've found:

## What We Have
Firstly, what options we have already in the department to try before the purchase/use instead

### We Have A Wireless EEG in the Dept
After Nik graduated (yay) Toby kind of kept her headset. It's a 20 channel dry wireless headset, (The CGX 20, theres no link to it anymore). Will took a picture of it for me cos he's a sweetheart.

A newer 20 channel versions is here: [CGX Quick-20r](https://www.cgxsystems.com/quick-20r). I can't easily find prices for this headset or these models, you contact and get quoted for them, but I can infer they are very expensive indeed.
I have permission from Toby to play around with the headset as soon as the dept's sign in/out systems are up and running.

### Durhams EEG Lab
Sarah is sending me a link to where we can sign up to use the Uni's EEG headsets. Psychology currently use [Emotiv headsets](https://www.emotiv.com/) (Sarah can't remember the specific make). They use eye tracking alongside built into the headset, and apart from the cost, Sarah says those are good headsets. We should try these out first to see if you like them, and try the one in the department to compare.

## General Points
- You've mentioned that having a headset that CAN be used with gel is a priority for better signal coherence 
- To the best of my knowledge, **Silver/Silver chloride (Ag-AgCl) electrodes are considered of reasonably highest quality**. [Source 1=OpenBCI](https://openbci.com/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/2173/the-advantage-of-sintered-ag-agcl-electrode), [Source 2=Some other website](https://www.biomedelectrodes.com/), [Source 3=Brain Computers very high quality](https://www.brainproducts.com/products_by_type.php?tid=3)
- Sarah further mentioned that **some journals only accept results from certain headsets** (sounds .... interesting). Emotiv ones and some other brands are currently trusted.
- Software Licsensing is expensive.

TODO:
- ADD SAMPLING RATE AND DYNAMIC RANGES OF INPUT VOLTAGES
- ADD WHAT LOBES/BRAIN ACTIVITY THEY COVER

## Current Thoughts
- OpenBCI seems the most flexible by far
- [Paper supporting OpenBCI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02438.pdf)
- Dont go emotiv, theyre protectionist bastards
- Brain Products (Germany) seem the most high quality

## Custom Built
See the upper-directory (and consult with me ofc) about how to make an EEG headset with a chosen number of channels yourself on the cheap.

- (RANT) I cannot believe the markup on some of these fucking products. I understand wanting to make a profit, and having a customer base of researchers with this budget in mind. But [$4000 for a 20 channel amplifier with a bit of bluetooth, a connector and a battery](http://www.physio-tech.co.jp/products/cognionics/pdf/cognionics2019.pdf).
